                        <h3>Anti-Virus</h3>
                        <p>
For the most part the way that Linux has been engineered makes it harder for viruses to target it. In the future Linux is projected to become a bigger target. In the meantime running an anti-virus applicaion helps protect other systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Ultimately making sure that your system has up to date software is some of the best protection. Scanning with anti-virus software is a bonus along with scanning for rootkits.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Disk Encryption</h3>
                        <p>
Full disk encryption protects your data by cryptographically encoding your data requiring a passphrase to unlock it. Though if you lose your passphrase your data is very difficult or impossible to reasonably recover.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Use this to prevent from unauthorized access to your data. For example booting from an alternate disk and mounting your devices and accessing your data.
                        </p>

                <!-- Firewalls -->
                <section>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Firewalls</h3>
                        <p>
The Linux firewall lives as a part of the kernel and is a packet filter. In the kernel it is netfilter, from the cli you traditionally use iptables, and now you can use ufw(uncomplicated firewall) for easier use. If you want a GUI interface you can use GUFW.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Practically what is happening is that netfilter inspects packets coming in to the network interfaces and if a packet matches a rule you can allow, delete, or reject.
                        </p>
                        <p>
This is a big deal for security because if you have a firewall in place you can block traffic from an attacker before it talks applications on your computer.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Passwords</h3>
                        <p>
Your password is your first line of security so choose wisely.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <p>
When choosing a password first try to understand the password requirements and limitations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
If you need to use a short password use both upper and lower case letters and numbers. If possible use special characters and whitespaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
If you are able to use a longer password try to choose a passphrase with words separated by whitespaces which may be easier to remember.
                        </p>
                        <p>
The Krebs Dos and Don'ts is good to keep in mind.
